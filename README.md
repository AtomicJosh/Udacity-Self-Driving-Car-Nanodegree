# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree

The Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree (SDC-ND) consisted of three terms, each of which having project based learning. These projects are contained in this repository. Each project directory has a README with more detail and/or a self explanatory Jupyter Notebook. In addition, all code is heavily commented, so understanding the code should be relatively easy.

This program was completed in July of 2019. The certificate of completion can be [viewed here](graduation_certificate.pdf).

Below is an overview of the SDC-ND program and what is contained in the project directories. Please see the associated project directories for further detail.

## Term 1: Computer Vision and Deep Learning

### Introduction

Learn about how self-driving cars work, and the first autonomous vehicle project - finding lane lines on the road. Also introduces the Nanodegree Program and the services provided over the course of the journey.

- Project: Finding Lane Lines on the Road

### Deep Learning

Deep learning has become the most important frontier in both machine learning and autonomous vehicle development. Experts from NVIDIA and Uber ATG will teach how to build deep neural networks and train them with data from the real world and from the Udacity simulator.

- Project: Traffic Sign Classifier 
- Project: Behavioral Cloning

### Computer Vision

Use a combination of cameras, software, and machine learning to find lane lines on difficult roads and to track vehicles. Starts with calibrating cameras and manipulating images, and end by applying support vector machines and decision trees to extract information from video.

- Project: Advanced Lane Finding 
- Project: Vehicle Tracking

## Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control

### Sensor Fusion

Tracking objects over time is a major challenge for understanding the environment surrounding a vehicle. Sensor fusion engineers from Mercedes-Benz will show you how to program fundamental mathematical tools called Kalman filters. These filters predict and determine with certainty the location of other vehicles on the road.

- Project: Extended Kalman Filters 
- Project: Unscented Kalman Filters

### Localization

Localization is how we determine where our vehicle is in the world. GPS is great, but it’s only accurate to within a few meters. We need single-digit centimeter-level accuracy! To achieve this, Mercedes-Benz engineers will demonstrate the principles of Markov localization to program a particle filter, which uses data and a map to determine the precise location of a vehicle.

- Project: Kidnapped Vehicle

### Control

Ultimately, a self-driving car is still a car, and we need to send steering, throttle, and brake commands to move the car through the world. Uber ATG will walk you through building both proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and model predictive controllers. Between these control algorithms, you’ll become familiar with both basic and advanced techniques for actuating a vehicle.

- Project: PID Controller
- Project: Model Predictive Control

## Term 3: Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems

### Path Planning

The Mercedes-Benz Vehicle Intelligence team will take you through the three stages of path planning. First, you’ll apply model-driven and data-driven approaches to predict how other vehicles on the road will behave. Then you’ll construct a finite state machine to decide which of several maneuvers your own vehicle should undertake. Finally, you’ll generate a safe and comfortable trajectory to execute that maneuver.

- Project: Path Planning Project

### Advanced Deep Learning

Students in this elective, built with the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, will learn about semantic segmentation, and inference optimization, active areas of deep learning research. This course is an elective. Students choose between completing either Advanced Deep Learning or Functional Safety for graduation.

- Project: Advanced Deep Learning

### System Integration

This is the capstone of the entire Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program! We’ll introduce Carla, the Udacity self-driving car, and the Robot Operating System (ROS) that controls her. You’ll work with a team of the Nanodegree students to combine what you’ve learned over the course of the entire Nanodegree Program to drive Carla, a real self-driving car, around the Udacity test track!

- Project: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car
